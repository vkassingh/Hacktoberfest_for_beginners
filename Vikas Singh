Hi everyone!
first of all thanks to all the maintainers of this repo and for introducing the concept of Open Source to all of us through hacotberfest. 
I am just a begginer contributor to open souce.

My name is VIKAS SINGH and I am in my 3rd year of BE in ECE at GGSIPU. Looking forward for more opportunities in the world of Open Source.
